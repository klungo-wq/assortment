In The Court Of The Crimson King -

Almost unarguably the first, most quintessential prog-rock album ever, Court virtually came out of nowhere, and almost single-handedly defined "prog-rock" at its infancy. Taking "metal" and "experimental" to their extremes, and making use of some of the first truly textured "atmospheres" (fuzz paranoia in Schizoid Man, dreamy surreality in Wind, etc.), Fripp & Co. put prog-rock on the map with this flawless, in-your-face album. In addition to introducing us to Fripp's schizo-paranoid madness, you can hear how much Bruford learned from Michael Giles. Court belongs to a small pantheon of albums that includes Sgt. Pepper, Dark Side, The Lamb, The Wall and maybe half a dozen other absolutely must-have albums.

 What can one add about this seminal album? The sound is remarkably clean, Bruford is busy and technical on the drums, Wakeman is majestic and the musical composition is amongst the best Yes ever managed. Siberian Khatru is a great track, but is the weakest of the three on the album! This work stands the test of time and is an absolute must-hear for any fan of progressive rock music.
